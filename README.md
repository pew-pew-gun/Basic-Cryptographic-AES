# Basic-Cryptographic-AES
384-bit permutation on a cryptographic sponge

Implemented a basic cryptographic Authenticated Encryption Scheme (AES) using a basic MAC system and a 384-bit permutation hash function based on a data structure known as the cryptographic sponge.

The skeleton code and driver functions have been graciously provided by Grady Fitzpatrick and Aiden Dang of the University of Melbourne.
